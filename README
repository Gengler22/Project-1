This code represents multiple charts that are created from the data set within the "data" file. 6 bar charts are created, representing the # of stars in
said exoplanet's solar system, # of other planets, the stars' stellar values, the exoplanet discovery method, the number of planets discovered each year,
and the zone location of these exoplanets, determining whether they are potentially habitable or not. There is also a histogram representing the distance
these exoplanets are from Earth. There is also a scatterplot that shows the relationship between the radius and mass of these exoplanets. Last but not
least, there is a line chart that shows how many exoplanets were discovered each year. Each of these charts are interactive in their own way, whether that
is through a brush, filtering, linking, or bin number, you can interact with these charts and the data is manipulated accordingly.
